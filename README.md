## Project Descriptionüìù
This project implements a bottle filling machine controlled by a DELTA PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The machine automates the process of filling bottles and uses pneumatic actuators to pick and place the filled bottles. This system is designed to increase efficiency and accuracy in bottle filling operations, making it ideal for industrial applications.

## Features ü™Ñ
-   **Automated Bottle Filling:** Precisely fills bottles to the desired level.
-   **Pick and Place Mechanism:** Uses pneumatic actuators to move filled bottles to the next stage of the production line.
-   **High Efficiency:** Designed for high-speed and high-accuracy operations.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to operate with minimal human intervention.
-   **Customizable:** Can be adjusted to handle different bottle sizes and fill levels.

## Prerequisites üåü
-   DELTA PLC with appropriate programming software (e.g., WPLSoft or ISPSoft)
-   Pneumatic actuators and related control components
-   Sensors for detecting bottle presence and fill levels
-   Relay modules for interfacing between PLC and pneumatic actuators
-   Power supply and safety equipment

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è
1.  **Set Up the Hardware:**
    
    -   **PLC Installation:** Mount the DELTA PLC on the control panel and connect it to the power supply.
    -   **Pneumatic Actuators:** Install the pneumatic actuators for picking and placing bottles. Ensure they are properly connected to the air supply and control valves.
    -   **Sensors:** Place sensors at the necessary positions to detect bottle presence and fill levels. Connect these sensors to the PLC input terminals.
    -   **Relays:** Use relay modules to interface the PLC outputs with the pneumatic actuators.
2.  **Programming the PLC:**
    
    -   **Software Installation:** Install the appropriate DELTA PLC programming software (e.g., WPLSoft or ISPSoft) on your computer.
    -   **Download the PLC Program:** Transfer the provided PLC program to the DELTA PLC using the programming software.
    -   **Configuration:** Adjust the program parameters to match your specific requirements, such as bottle size and fill level.

## Usage
1.  **Power On the System:**
    
    -   Ensure that the power supply is connected and all components are securely installed.
    -   Turn on the PLC and the pneumatic system.
2.  **Operation:**
    
    -   **Start the Machine:** Use the start button or HMI (Human Machine Interface) to initiate the bottle filling process.
    -   **Filling Process:** The machine will automatically detect bottles, fill them to the desired level, and use pneumatic actuators to pick and place the filled bottles.
    -   **Monitoring:** Monitor the process through the HMI or control panel. The system will provide real-time status updates and alerts if any issues are detected.
3.  **Adjustments and Maintenance:**
    
    -   Regularly check the sensors and actuators for proper functioning.
    -   Make adjustments to the PLC program or hardware setup as needed to ensure optimal performance.
    -   Perform routine maintenance on pneumatic components to prevent leaks and ensure smooth operation.
